		<h2>Readings</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Master Mobile UX, video series
				<ul>
					<li>Videos about mobile first web design and development. Why they're important for us developers and for people. This are concepts that I already learned on previous courses (2 other of them, at least).</li>
					<li>The video "How to Improve UX by Understanding Users" has a (some) great idea(s): Users really don't know what they want (for the most part). Also many of the ideas are a good review of previous classes I've taken.</li>
					<li>I have the feeling that I already watched these videos. Probably I did.</li>
					<li>I learn something new: Phone number links... <a href="tel:+555">Phone</a> I haven't seen those that often really (at least programmatically).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
