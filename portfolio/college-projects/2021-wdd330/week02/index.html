		<ol>
			<li>Novice to Ninja
				<ul>
					<li>Ch2: Programming basics <span class="lime">→</span> Much of this should be review, but pay special attention to the sections on variables, scope, converting/parsing, and template literals. <span class="lime">→</span> <span class="red">Read</span>
						<ul>
							Notes on this reading:
							<li>Good comments and documentation is something I've always appreciated. Grammar is also soemthing I pay attention to when I'm writing in any language: I really like to follow good practices and best standards. </li>
							<li><code>var</code> and <code>let</code> have always given me some trouble when learning their differences in JS. Here I learned that the main difference is that <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> have block scope(d). They also prevent you from overwriting any built-in methods by assignment, which is generally frowned upon, whereas using <code>var</code> doesn't.</li>
							<li>"<code>let</code> as used in formalized mathematics (especially the writing of proofs) indicates that the current instance of a variable exists only for the scope of that logical idea.", from a StackOverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/43193811/7389293">answer</a>.</li>
							<li>"<code>let</code> implements restricted scope of functions, in block structures.", <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/37917089/7389293">here</a>.</li>
							<li>Use <code>const</code> whenever possible.</li>
							<li>Variables that start with an underscore <code>_</code> generally refer to private properties and methods./li>
							<li>Direct assignment (in primitive data types) and, assignment by reference (in objetcs), is always an interesting topic.</li>
							<li>String literals Vs String objects, always good to remember the difference. Some other caveats on strings are mentioned, which is cool.</li>
							<li>Template literals and interpolation: <code>`She said, "I'm going to be ${ age + 1} years old next year."`</code>... Using backticks <code>`</code></li>
							<li>Symbols primitive data type: <code>const uniqueID = Symbol('this is a description of the symbol');</code>, which main use-case is as object property keys.</li>
							<li>JS is <strong>weakly typed</strong> or <strong>loosely typed</strong> language. This means you don't need to explicitly speficy what data-type a variable is when you declare it. <strong>Strongly typed</strong> languages are: Java, Swift, TypeScript.</li>
							<li><strong>FALSY</strong> boolean values: <code>""</code>, <code>''</code>, <code>``</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>-0</code>, <code>NaN</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>. In other languages, zero and empty strings are not falsy.</li>
							<li>JS uses <strong>Lazy Evaluation</strong> of logical statements: This means it stops evaluating any further operands once the result is clear. This means:
								<ul>
									<li>
										"For example, for a logical AND expression to be true, all the operands have to be
										true; if any of them are false, there is no point checking any subsequent
										operands as the result will still be false. Similarly, for a logical OR to be true,
										only one of the operands has to be true; hence, as soon as an operand is evaluated
										to true, the result is returned as true and any subsequent operands won’t be
										checked as the result is of no consequence."
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Logical operators can be used to check if compound statements are true or false.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Ch3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops <span class="lime">→</span> Again much of this should feel like review. Pay special attention to the section on array methods. <span class="lime">→</span> <span class="red">Read</span>
						<ul>
							Notes on this reading:
							<li>Review of ARRAYS, their properties and methods. Multidimensional arrays. Arrays are ordered list of values.</li>
							<li><i>Callbacks</i> are mentioned when talking about array sorting. Callbacks are functions passed as an argument to a function. It the book's case when dealing with <code>myArray.sort();</code>. This topic is covered in chapter 4 of the book.</i></li>
							<li>Review of SETS: Ordered lists of non-duplicate values. Data structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot include any duplicate values. They offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if any values have been duplicated. Example: <code>const list = new Set();</code>. Sets can be worked with arrays in many different ways.</li>
							<li>Some definitions:
								<ol>
									<li><code>Memory Leaks</code>: Occur when a program retains references to values that can no longer be accessed in its memory.</li>
									<li><code>Garbage collection</code>: Dynamic memory management technique, which is the process of automatically removing items from memory that are no longer required by the program.</li>
								</ol>	
							</li>
							<li>Review of MAPS: Ordered lists of key-value pairs. Convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs. They're similar to hashes, or hash-tables or dictionaries. Example: <code>const myMap = new Map();</code></li>
							<li>Review of logical conditions: <code>if</code> <code>else</code> statements, ternary operator, <code>switch</code> statement, <code>while</code> loop, <code>do ... while</code> loop, <code>for</code> loop.</li>
							<li>Loop examples on data structures
								<ul>
									<li>Arrays and sets: <code>for (const letter of letters) { console.log(letter); }</code></li>
									<li>Maps: <code>for (const key of numbers.keys()) { console.log(key); }</code></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Ch4: Functions <span class="lime">→</span> Note that there are multiple ways to declare a function in Javascript. Pay close attention to the concept of callbacks as well. <span class="lime">→</span> <span class="red">Read</span>
