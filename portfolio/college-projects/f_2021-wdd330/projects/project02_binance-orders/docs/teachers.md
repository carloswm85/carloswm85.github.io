# Now

1. Be able to get a list of crypto to show for buy or sell locally.
2. Be able to select a crypto from a drop down and buy or sell, populating the current prices.
3. Validate all the fields.
4. Make your percentages work based on the crypto values downloaded.
5. Store any buy and sell with the amount, cost, cost per coin, trade date, all locally with localStorage.

And: 

- For this course, you will want to wrap related functionality in class objects. I am not a real fan of the ES6 classes in javascript. I am a fan of prototypal classes in javascript as the language and runtime really work. So I would for my project, add to objects and prototypes (components) rather than create classes.
- Adding functionality to the prototype of the class is prototypal, real time, component based inheritance. That is how javascript was designed and is how I think it should be used. ‚Üê Good.
- Each function (class) has a prototype made when you "new" a function into a class. You add functions to that prototype of that function or the prototype of its parents.

# Later
