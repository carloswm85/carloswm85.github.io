The files included here are meant to go along with the interactive coding demos in course "PineScript Indicator Development" by Kevin Dostalek and currently published on the UDEMY platform. Note that not *all* code shown in the course is included. Generally only "final states" of the scripts are included at different points of the course. The first few optional "You Code It" challenges have possible solutions show, but please keep in mind that these are but examples of many possible solutions. The later challenges are not included for this reason.
